Complete the function below to return a ragged two-dimensional list.  For each
value in the given column counts list, a row, with than number of columns, should
be added to the two-dimensional list.  If the column count is less than 1, that
columne count should be skipped and a row is not added to the two dimensional
list.  The value of each column should be it's column number, starting at 1.

To receive full credit, your solution should be one line and use list
comprehension.  Any solutions more than one line will receive at most 88%.

Main contains a call to the function with the following list:
    [3, -1, 1, 6, 0, 2, 8]

And prints each row.  Your output should match the following exactly:
    [1, 2, 3]
    [1]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    [1, 2]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
